## Team Building
Great products are built by teams. Great companies are built by teams. A product manager succeeds by being a great team player.
### Mission-driven
The team has to have an aspirational, long-range mission to guid it.
### Goal-oriented
A team needs a set of objective, quantified goals.
### Values-based
A team needs an established set of norms, their culture, their ways of working.
#### Communication
- IRL is best. Face-to-face conversations bring all the elements necessary--verbal, non-verbal, kinesthetic, visual, aural, real-time interaction.
- Virtual is a double-edged sword. Small groups are effective. In large groups, people will tune out and turn off.
- Listening. Listen. Listen. Two ears, one mouth, but actually listen 10x more than speak.
- Draw. Get up to the whiteboard and draw things. Interactive and iterative.
#### Empathy
#### Selfless commitment to making the whole greater than the sum of its parts
#### Intentionally attenuating the energy of mimetic desire
